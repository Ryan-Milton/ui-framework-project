![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) JS Framework Comparative Analysis
=======================================================================

## Knockout.js

### Research Conducted By: Ryan && George

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 7
#### General Comments
Describe the stack (front-end only? full stack?), database, efficiency, etc. Describe the general usability and learnability
* We think it's a primarily front end stack but can do a bit of the backend when partnered with ajax or other packages.

#### Pros
* "Hot Update"
* Easy to Learn
* Good tutorials in the Docs

#### Cons
* Tutorials don't show where you messed up.

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Documentation is quite clear and easy to understand. BUT. They throw punches at jQuery.
An example is as follows, 
* "To summarise: KO doesn’t compete with jQuery or similar low-level DOM APIs. KO provides a complementary, high-level way to link a data model to a UI. KO itself doesn’t depend on jQuery, but you can certainly use jQuery at the same time, and indeed that’s often useful if you want things like animated transitions."

#### Systems Requirements
The requirements are that your computer function... it is an EXTREMELY lightweight library.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
If junior or mid level devs were to use this the transition wouldn't take long at all. For a small project, between 2 days to a week (depending on complexity). For a medium sized project, a week to a month. For a large sized project, a month to 6 months or so.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
How popular is this framework? What big companies are running on it? How is it "seen" in the general JS community?  Is there an active community of developers supporting and growing it?
