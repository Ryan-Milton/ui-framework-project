=========================================================================


## Before you begin
* Visit and familiarize yourself with the [ToDo MVC Project](http://todomvc.com)
* Create a new repository for your work, with the name of the framework you have been assigned.

## Assignment
For the purposes of educating your class/teammates, your group will research and implement a "Counter" application using your assigned framework, with the following features:

### UI
* A `<button>`, which when clicked will **increment** the counter value
* A `<button>`, which when clicked will **decrement** the counter value
* An `<h2>` containing the value of the counter
* Apply styles using the methodology best suited to (or recommended by) your assigned framework to make the elements look cohesive and interesting ...
  * Increment button on the right
  * Decrement button on the left
  * Counter in the middle
  * Change the color of the counter value when the number is `<`, `===`, or `>` 0

### Implementation
Implementation will vary depending on the framework that you've been assigned.
* If your framework supports a "Back End", increment the count on the back-end and send that value (or markup) to the client
* Otherwise, implement the full counter functionality on the client side.


### Stretch Goals:
* Deploy your running appliation to either Heroku or Amazon
* Repeat the process, recreating the socket.io chat applet


###  Documentation
Complete the README.md file included in the lab folder

### Presentation
Prepare a presentation (10-15 minutes) that details the implemention requirements of your framework. Format this as a mini-lecture, with the mindset being that your task is to quickly "spin up" a small team of developers to implement a new feature in this framework.

Give us just enough information for us to "go on" so that we could reproduce your work without having to feel the pain of R&D that you went through.
